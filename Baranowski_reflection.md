*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
Prior to the GPS session I felt pretty good with the Git concepts. 

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
The guide tried to clarify the _git fetch_ and _git merge_ concepts, but I'm still a little confused by the two so asked some peers for help and will be doing more of my own research.

Merge conflicts were also clarified for me. I hadn't experienced merge conflict yet so actually making one and working through it was helpful. 

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
We asked questions regarding when you would use _git fetch_ and _git merge_ and why you would choose to use those features instead of _git pull_.

*What still confuses you about Git?*
git fetch and git merge

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
It was great. I really enjoyed working with my peer, and it was beneficial to have someone there to ask questions when needed.
